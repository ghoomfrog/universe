If you have an idea that can improve humanity in any way, create a pull request with a markdown file describing your idea inside its respective topic folder (create the folder if it doesn't exist yet; see issue labels for reference on naming).

You can also create pull requests editing an existing idea and describing the reasoning behind your changes.
