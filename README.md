If you have an idea that can improve humanity in any way, create a pull request with a markdown file describing your idea inside its respective topic folder (create the folder if it doesn't exist yet; see issue labels for reference on naming).

You can also create pull requests editing an existing idea and describing the reasoning behind your changes.

# Guidelines

1. Be selfless
2. Write as concisely as possible (if you have doubts about its clarity, clarify it more!)
3. If relevant, include one or more diagrams along your idea ([app.diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net) is a free diagram tool)
4. Put the name of your idea in the filename, all in lowercase
