This repository hosts world-improving ideas that one can't realize, stored as markdown files in their respective (main) topic folders.

If you have an idea that can improve humanity in any way, create a pull request with a markdown file describing your idea inside its respective topic folder (create the folder if it doesn't exist yet, all in lowercase).

You can also create pull requests editing an existing idea and describing the reasoning behind your changes. If you think an idea can be improved but don't know how, open an issue about it.
