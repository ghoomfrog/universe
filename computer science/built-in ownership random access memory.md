# Built-in Ownership Random Access Memory

BIORAM, or Built-in Ownership Random Access Memory, is a type of RAM where each cell is associated with the address of the process for which it is allocated. Although this model incurs an additional cost for the total number of cells in a RAM chip, it significantly reduces the time required for allocation, deallocation and ownership transferal operations that are traditionally performed using memory management units.
