# Interlaced Significand and Exponent

Interlaced Significand and Exponent (ISE) is a rational number format based on standard floating point, designed to be resizable with no additional computation. Though, the format doesn't inherit NaNs and infinity. All values are arithmetic.

The format is a sequence of contiguous chunks composed of 3 significand bits followed by 1 exponent bit. The significand is the reversed concatenated significand bits, and the exponent is the unreversed concatenated exponent bits. All bits beyond the number default to 0.

The mantissa is obtained as 0.*s* (where *s* is the significand).

The significand and the exponent can independently be signed. The signs are the least significant bits of their respective parts. A sign of 0 denotes positivity.

Here's a comparison of a fully signed number (with both a signed significand and exponent) formatted in both 64-bit floating-point and 64-bit ISE. Bold bits are part of the exponent, and italicized ones are signs. The least significant bits are to the right.
