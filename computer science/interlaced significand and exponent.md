# Interlaced Significand & Exponent

Interlaced Significand & Exponent (ISE) is a rational number format based on [IEEE 754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754) (floating point), designed to be resizable with no additional computation. Though, the format doesn't inherit NaNs and infinities. All values are arithmetic.

The format is a sequence of contiguous chunks composed of 3 significand bits followed by 1 exponent bit. The significand is the reversed concatenated significand bits plus one, and the exponent is the unreversed concatenated exponent bits. All bits beyond the number default to 0.

The reason behind adding one to the raw significand is to eliminate redundancies of the 0 significand: since $0\cdot2^k$ is always $0$.

The mantissa is 0.*s* where *s* is the significand.

The significand and the exponent can independently be signed. The signs are the least significant bits of their respective parts. A sign of 0 denotes positivity.

Here's a comparison of a fully signed number (with both a signed significand and exponent) formatted in both 64-bit floating-point and 64-bit ISE. **Bold** bits are part of the exponent, and *italicized* ones are signs. The least significant bits are to the right.
