# Limited Variable

A limited variable is a variable whose domain[^domain] is finite, in contrast with conventional <ins>unlimited</ins> variables.

[^domain]: the set of possible values it can represent

## Existential Algebra

A <ins>possibility</ins> is a limited variable defined in $\set{0, 1}$, used as a factor to describe a possibility of existence.

A <ins>bet</ins> is the multiplication of an object $x$, called a <ins>candidate</ins>, and a possibility $?$[^reading], resulting in a limited variable defined in $\set{0, x}$, called a hemis[^hemis-etymology].

[^reading]: *x?* is read "possible *x*"
[^hemis-etymology]: from Ancient Greek *ἥμισυς* "half" and Latin *est* "is"

Possibility multiplication, or <ins>polydyny</ins>[^polydyny-etymology], is equivalent to logical conjunction. Possibilities multiplied by other possibilities are called <ins>polydynates</ins> or <ins>subpossibilities</ins>. Said possibilities are <ins>dependencies</ins> of their <ins>superpossibility</ins>.

[^polydyny-etymology]: from Ancient Greek *πολῠ́ς* "many" and *δῠνᾰτός* "possible"

## Bisign Algebra

A <ins>bisign</ins> is a limited variable defined in $\set{-1, 1}$, used as a factor to describe sign ambiguity.
